# GPS 1.1 Reflect

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Initial I was still struggling with merge conflicts and pushing and pulling files from github. I was also a bit confused as to when in the workflow you would need to submit a pull request to github.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Most of the concepts I had questions on were clarified. I think I have a better understanding now . 


* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? Most of my questions centered around merging branches and pushing and pulling files into and from github


* What still confuses you about Git? I'm still a bit confused as to the concept of what fetching does and why it's needed.



* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I was nervous about what to expect but it went pretty smoothly. My guide was very good at easing me into the process. He helped me understand the concepts I had trouble with by explaining them in a way that i could understand.
